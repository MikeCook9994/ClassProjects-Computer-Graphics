## Drawing Modes

1. Immediate Mode
    * Immediately draws the object as instructed to the context
    * Pros:
        * More control; things happen immeidately
    * Cons:
        * Slow; does not take any advantage of parallelism
2. Retained Mode
    * Instruct a collection of what you want drawn before actually instructing to draw it

## Coordinates and Coordinate Systems

* Origin point
    * Symbolized with O
* Axis vectors
    * A line drawn between two points
        * have an origin and a terminating point
    * Two vectors are equal if:
        1. They are the same length
        2. They are parallel
* The Sum of two vectors is the terminating point of the second vector if it begins at the terminating point of the first
* A point P can be defined as P(a,b) where a and b are scalars to the vectors u and v such that P = a(u) + b(v)
* P can be defined as O' such that another coing P' can be defined as the vector from O to O' plus the vector from O' to P
