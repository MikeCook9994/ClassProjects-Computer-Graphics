## Transforms

### Transitional Transforms

* Used to translate a vector from one coordinate plane to another.
* Given a vector (Vx, Vy) we can translate it a vector in another coordinate system, P(a, b)by defining the new vector as (Vx + a, Vy + b)
* Translations are useful because we can duplicate objects by simply translating them to another location based on another coordinate system.

### Scale Transforms

* Want to transform an existing object into a different object with possibly different proportions
* For each vector we define a scalar multiplier, b, such that given the original vector u and the scaled vector u':
    * u' = u(b)
* Thus for an object with n vectors we would define it's scalar vector as:
    * Scale(A1, A2, ..., An)

### Rotational Transforms
* Rotates a vector from (a, b) to (a', b') by rotating it by some degree.
* Revolve around a singluar point

In canvas, tranformations are applied inverse of the order they are written sequentially
  * stack instead of queue

### Save and Restore

* Individual drawing commands directly manipulates the top of the drawing stack
    * The top of the drawing stack is the only thing that gets drawn
* The save command duplicates the top of the stack so a copy of the frame is saved
    * You can then operate on this layer of the stack
* The restore command pops off the top of the stack and draws the layer under
* Could be used to draw half of an animation and then restore to return back to the original state of the animation
