## Algebraic representations of transformations

* General form of transforms is (x'1 x'2 ... x'n) = A(x1 x2 ... xn) + (t1 t2 ... tn)
  * A is the identity matrix with dimension n

### Translations

* Given an initial vector (x y) the result of that translation (x' y') can be computer by adding another vector (dx dy) such that (x' - dx = x) and (y' - dy = y)
* General Form: A(x1 x2 ... xn) + (dx1 dx2 dxn) = (x'1 x'2 ... x'n)

### Scaling

* Scaling occurs around the origin
    * Origin is not scaled at all
* Each vector is scaled by a scalar vector (s)
* General Form: A(s) + (0) <-- 0 vector with dimension equal to A

### Rotations

* Rotates by an angle theta (%)
* General Form (x' y') = ((cos(%) * -sin(%)) (sin(%)cos(%)))(x y) + (0)
   * Here, the vector of trignometric functions is our identity matrix

### Composing Transformations

These transformations define the building blocks from which we can build other transformations
* e.g. a shear is built out of a rotation and Scaling

Given a matrix (x y z) that is transformed into matrix (x' y' z') that is composed of two transformations
* We define a vector T1((x y z)) as A1(x y z) + t1
* Thus (x' y' z') can be defined as A2(T1((x y z))) + t2
  * Which we can further decompose to: A2(A1(x y z) + t1) + t2 = A2(A1(x y z)) + A2t1 + t2
* This clearly gets out of control as the number of transforms increases which makes it difficult to make fast

## Homogenous Coordinates

We can represent an entire transform of a 3 x 1 vector as a 4 x 4 matrix such that
* This makes chaining transformations as simple as the multiplication of multiple 4 x 4 matrices
    * (x y z) -> T1 -> (x' y' z') T2 -> (x'' y'' z'')
        * Represents (x y z) -> T12 -> (x'' y'' z'') which we can compute as the product of T2 * T1 where T2 and T1 are the 4 x 4 matrix representations of their transformations of their 3 x 1 input matrix
            * Multiplication occurs in inverse order of application (T1 is the last term in the sequence)

TWIGL (the matrix library we will use), it assumes the transpose as input and outputs the transpose
