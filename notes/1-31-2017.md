## TWGL

* TWGL allows us to generate matrices representing our transformations
    * If we want to rotate then translate then scale our coordinate plane, we multiply the 4 x 4 homogenous matrix cooresponding with 
     the rotation with the matrix cooresponding to our translation. The resulting matrix is then multiplied by the matrix corresponding 
     to our scale

* Save and restore are semantically useless here because we can't utilize canvas's transformation functions.
    * If we want access to a stack, we can use an array to achieve the same semenatics that allow for us to keep track of our transformations
