# Februrary 14th 2017 Lectures Notes

## Camera

* The transformation representing the camera must result in 3 axes that orient that world with
respect to the world.
    * u points along the horizon
    * v runs vertically
    * w runs toward the eye of the viewers (backwards from the camera)

* w can be defined by defining a vector from the eye (where you are viewing from) to the target and inverting it
    * this vector that runs from eye to target is called the gaze vector
    * divide this vector by it's length to normalize it

* Define a vector top, that when projected onto the viewport always appears horizontally
    * this vector will always be perpindicular to u
    * Thus, top crossed with w and normalized will give u

* Because u and w exist on the same plane, w cross u (does not need to normalized), will give you vector

## orthographic projections

* TWGLs orthographic projections inherently rescales the world from between given bounds for the axes between 1 and -1
    * The w axes is between -1 and 0
        * Just a TWGL convention
* The coordinates within this space are normalized device coordiantes
* This scaling disambiguates the real world coordinates and the window we are viewing through
    * Allows us to explicitly define what we see at the bounds of our screen regardless of its resolution
    * If we didn't do this, we would have different views on a 1080p screen vs a 4k screen

## Perspective Projection
* orthographic projections do not acurately relfect how we see things
    * objects farther away appear smaller
* simple projections just use triangles that are defined with points in space and some vector origianting from the eye
    * this allows us to define similar points that are colliding with our viewport and allow us to redraw things with distance accounted for

### semantics
* previously, if we had a homogenous represention (x y z 1) we mean (x y z)
* Now, in a homogenous representation (ax ay az aw) is equivalent to (x y z w)
    * we can now say (x/w y/w z/w w/w) which is really (x/w y/w z/w 1)
        * multipled by 1/w (just scaled the vector) it's still the same vector
* this is important for some reason

## TWGL perspective matrix
* perspective(fov, aspect, zNear, zFar)
    * returns a 4 x 4 matrix
    * fov -> field of views (specify focal length)
        * defined as an angle of view
    * aspect -> defines the aspect ratio between the horizontal (defined by FOV) and the y
    * zNear -> remapped to -1 for depth
        * negated by TWGL, you should provide -zNear
    * zFar -> remapped to +1 for depth
        * negated by TWGL, you should provide -zFar

## Making object solid
* Draw from back to front 
* Painers algorithm
    * define geometry as triangles
    * sort
    * redraw
* Problems with painters
    * does not handle interesctions well
    * requires resorting whenever the camera moves
    * overdraws

* Alternative solution
    * each pixel of the screen contains a color and depth
    * algorithm:
        * clear all the pixels
        * for each triangle
            * for each pixel write z value that is closest and store its depth

* Z-fighting 
    * when depths are near equivalent
