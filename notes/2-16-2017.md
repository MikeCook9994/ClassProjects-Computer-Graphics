* Lighting is composed of: 
    * L = I<sub>a</sub> + I<sub>d</sub> + I<sub>s</sub>
    * I<sub>a</sub>: Ambient Lighting
        * A very complex problem so we use a contant to assign some base background color
    * I<sub>d</sub>: Diffuse Reflection
        * [class notes](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-0/p280x280/16779819_10210962461488997_463292176_n.jpg?oh=3dca2a0f1b02897fe1ba26e94da2c81e&oe=58A7C561) 
        * Considers how specular reflection is changed when the plane the light strikes is not perfectly flat
            * Results in light being reflected in all directions
        * The amount of light diffused is:
            * L: the length of the object
            * cos(%): the angle between the object's normal and 
            * such that:  
        * matte: Any material that is perfectly diffused
    * I<sub>s</sub>: Specular Reflection
        * How light is defused over perfectly flat surfaces
        * vector -L is the light source; L is it's inverse
        * vector e is the direction of the eye
        * i is the angle between -L and the normal
        * r is the angle between e and the normal
        * vector v is the angle perfectly between the normal and -Lecture
        * vector h is vector v + L divided by their length
        * L = K<sub>r</sub>||dot(normal, h)||<sup>p</sup>
            * p and K<sub>r</sub> are constants that can manipulate the light
