## Key Ideas
  1) Work in convenient coordinate systems. Use transformations to get to where we need to be

## Transitioning from 2D to 3D 

### Similarites
  * Representations of points only adds the additional variable in 3D
    * point: (x, y) -> (x, y, z)
    * homogenous matrix vector: (x, y, 1) -> (x, y, z, 1)

  * Translations hardly change, just add the additional coordinate
    * The homogenous matrix just includes the translation along the z axis as well

  * Scales also only introduce one additional variable in the point as well
    *  an additional dimension in the identity matrix to account for that additional scalar value

### Differences
  * A 2D coordinate plane can just be rotated or flipped to achieve a different system
    * This is not true of 3D coordinate planes. 
      * However any orientation of axis can be oriented to be "left handed" or "right handed"
        * left handed can not be rotated to be right handed
        * left handed: given u, v, w u faces the front and v the back
        * right handed: the adjunct of the above
        
  * Rotations
    * Any rotation in 3D, scures some axis, identified or not, and rotates about that point
    * Any rotation that preserves lengths, preserves angles, and preserves handendness of the
    plane, can be proved to be a rotation around a single arbitary axis

## Vector Quantities

* Dot Product:
  * ||u|| * ||v||cos(%) such that % is the angle between u and v
  * This is equivalent to U1(V1) + U2(V2) + U3(V3)
  * Lengths of vectors are easily computable so with simple algebra we can find this angle

* Cross Product:
  * ||u x v|| = ||u|| * ||v|| * sin(%) such that % is the angle between them
  * u x v gives a vector on the plane perpindicular to u and v, call this w
  * the system defined by u, v, w gives a Right handed system
  * If u and v are unit length axes on a coordinate plane we know their length is 1 and 
  they are perpindicular so sin(%) is also 1. Thus the lenth of w is also 1.
  
## Camera

  * Define a location on your camera that is the eye
  * Define a target location on the object you want to look at
  * From this you can determine the vector between these two points and define how the location
  on the target should be drawn with respect to the target
