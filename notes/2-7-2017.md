# Febuary 7th 2017 Lecture Notes

## 4 Key concepts of graphics pipeline
1. Coordinate System
    * Transformations
    * Hierarchial modeling
2. Homogenous coordinates
3. Viewing Transforms
4. Primitive-based rendering
    * Using simple object to build more complex objects

## Review  on the previous lecture

## Drawing a 3D object in a 2D plane
1. Put a 3D primitive in the world
    * modeling
2. figure out its color
    * shading
3. position relative to the eye
    * shading/camera Transformation
4. remove objects not in the eye's field of Review
    * clipping
5. identify what goes on screen
    * projection
6. determine if something blocks it
    * visbility/occulusion
7. draw the 2d primitive
    * rasturization

## Key points of moving from 3D world to 2D screen
1. 3D points map to 2D points
2. 3D lines map to 2D lines
3. 3D triangles map to 2D triangles
4. A general curve of ellipses does not inherently map to a 2D equivalent
