# Febuary 7th 2017 Lecture Notes

## 4 Key concepts of graphics pipeline
1. Coordinate System
    * Transformations
    * Hierarchial modeling
2. Homogenous coordinates
3. Viewing Transforms
4. Primitive-based rendering
    * Using simple object to build more complex objects

## Review  on the previous lecture

## Drawing a 3D object in a 2D plane
1. Put a 3D primitive in the world
    * modeling
2. figure out its color
    * shading
3. position relative to the eye
    * shading/camera Transformation
4. remove objects not in the eye's field of Review
    * clipping
5. identify what goes on screen
    * projection
6. determine if something blocks it
    * visbility/occulusion
7. draw the 2d primitive
    * rasturization

## Key points of moving from 3D world to 2D screen
1. 3D points map to 2D points
2. 3D lines map to 2D lines
3. 3D triangles map to 2D triangles
4. A general curve of ellipses does not inherently map to a 2D equivalent

## Projection

Orthographic or prospective projection

* In an Orthographic projecction no distortion occurs.
    * A flat view of the 3D model
    * parallel lines remain parallel
    * No difference between objects far away and close by

* In a prespective view edes become distorted based on the viewing angle
    * 3D parallel lines do not reamain paralle. Meeting point is called vanishing point
    * distorts primitives to show depth information
