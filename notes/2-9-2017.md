## Visibility 

To solve the problem of visiblity, we need to abandon the ideal of drawing triangle's immediatley in this moment and instead define a recipe of the triangle we intend to
draw but without a defined order.

## Inverse Transform
* Given a linear mapping that maps a vector x to another vector x'
    * T: x -> x'
* The inverse of this linear map would the inverse linear mapping such that given x' it outputs x
    * T<sup>-1</sup>: x' -> x
* Given a homogenous representation of a vector (x y z 1) and multiplying it by T and then T<sup>-1</sup>, will given us (x y z 1)
* twgl.m4.inverse()

## Various coordinate systems

### Camera Coordinate system
* composed of
    * eye -> where your "lens" is that
    * target -> the point you plan to have at the center of your view
    * up -> disambiguates the angle of rotation around the remaining free axis
* the transform composed these parameters is the "look at" transform such that the target point is 0,0,0 with respect to the eye
